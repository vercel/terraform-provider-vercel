# vercel_log_drain (Resource)

Provides a Configurable Log Drain resource.

~> For Log Drain integrations, please see the [Integration Log Drain docs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains#log-drains-integration).

Log Drains collect all of your logs using a service specializing in storing app logs.

Teams on Pro and Enterprise plans can subscribe to log drains that are generic and configurable from the Vercel dashboard without creating an integration. This allows you to use a HTTP service to receive logs through Vercel's log drains.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Use the vercel_endpoint_verification data source to work out the verification code needed to
// verify the log drain endpoint.
data "vercel_endpoint_verification" "example" {
}

resource "vercel_log_drain" "example" {
  delivery_format = "json"
  environments    = ["production"]
  headers = {
    some-key = "some-value"
  }
  project_ids   = [vercel_project.example.id]
  sampling_rate = 0.8
  secret        = "a_very_long_and_very_well_specified_secret"
  sources       = ["static"]
  endpoint      = "https://example.com/my-log-drain-endpoint"
}

resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "example"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `delivery_format` (String) The format log data should be delivered in. Can be `json` or `ndjson`.
- `endpoint` (String) Logs will be sent as POST requests to this URL. The endpoint will be verified, and must return a `200` status code and an `x-vercel-verify` header taken from the endpoint_verification data source. The value the `x-vercel-verify` header should be can be read from the `vercel_endpoint_verification_code` data source.
- `environments` (Set of String) Logs from the selected environments will be forwarded to your webhook. At least one must be present.
- `sources` (Set of String) A set of sources that the log drain should send logs for. Valid values are `static`, `edge`, `external`, `build`, `lambda` and `firewall`.

### Optional

- `headers` (Map of String) Custom headers to include in requests to the log drain endpoint.
- `project_ids` (Set of String) A list of project IDs that the log drain should be associated with. Logs from these projects will be sent log events to the specified endpoint. If omitted, logs will be sent for all projects.
- `sampling_rate` (Number) A ratio of logs matching the sampling rate will be sent to your log drain. Should be a value between 0 and 1. If unspecified, all logs are sent.
- `secret` (String, Sensitive) A custom secret to be used for signing log events. You can use this secret to verify that log events are coming from Vercel and are not tampered with. See https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains/log-drains-reference#secure-log-drains for full info.
- `team_id` (String) The ID of the team the Log Drain should exist under. Required when configuring a team resource if a default team has not been set in the provider.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the Log Drain.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# If importing into a personal account, or with a team configured on
# the provider, simply use the log_drain_id.
# - log_drain_id can be found by querying the Vercel REST API (https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints/logDrains#retrieves-a-list-of-all-the-log-drains).
terraform import vercel_log_drain.example ld_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Alternatively, you can import via the team_id and edge_config_id.
# - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
# - log_drain_id can be found by querying the Vercel REST API (https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints/logDrains#retrieves-a-list-of-all-the-log-drains).
terraform import vercel_log_drain.example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/ld_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
