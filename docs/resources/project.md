# vercel_project (Resource)

Provides a Project resource.

A Project groups deployments and custom domains. To deploy on Vercel, you need to create a Project.

For more detailed information, please see the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# A project that is connected to a git repository.
# Deployments will be created automatically
# on every branch push and merges onto the Production Branch.
resource "vercel_project" "with_git" {
  name      = "example-project-with-git"
  framework = "nextjs"

  environment = [
    {
      key    = "bar"
      value  = "baz"
      target = ["preview"]
    }
  ]

  git_repository = {
    type = "github"
    repo = "vercel/some-repo"
  }
}

# A project that is not connected to a git repository.
# Deployments will need to be created manually through
# terraform, or via the vercel CLI.
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name      = "example-project"
  framework = "nextjs"

  environment = [
    {
      key    = "bar"
      value  = "baz"
      target = ["preview", "production"]
    }
  ]
}
```

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--git_repository))
- `install_command` (String) The install command for this project. If omitted, this value will be automatically detected.
- `output_directory` (String) The output directory of the project. When null is used this value will be automatically detected.
- `public_source` (Boolean) Specifies whether the source code and logs of the deployments for this project should be public or not.

# project_id can be found in the project `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
terraform import vercel_project.example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# If importing without a team, simply use the project ID.
terraform import vercel_project.personal_example prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
