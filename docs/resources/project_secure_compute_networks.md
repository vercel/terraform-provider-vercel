# vercel_project_secure_compute_networks (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "example-project"
}

data "vercel_secure_compute_network" "example" {
  name = "Example Network"
}

resource "vercel_project_secure_compute_networks" "example" {
  project_id = vercel_project.example.id
  secure_compute_networks = [
    {
      environment    = "production"
      network_id     = data.vercel_secure_compute_network.example.id
      passive        = false
      builds_enabled = true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the Project
- `secure_compute_networks` (Attributes Set) A set of Secure Compute Networks that the project should be configured with. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--secure_compute_networks))

### Optional

- `team_id` (String) The team ID. Required when configuring a team resource if a default team has not been set in the provider.

<a id="nestedatt--secure_compute_networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `secure_compute_networks`

Required:

- `builds_enabled` (Boolean) Whether the projects build container should be included in the Secure Compute Network.
- `environment` (String) The environment being configured. Should be one of 'production', 'preview', or the ID of a Custom Environment
- `network_id` (String) The ID of the Secure Compute Network to configure for this environment
- `passive` (Boolean) Whether the Secure Compute Network should be configured as a passive network, meaning it is used for passive failover.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# If importing with a team configured on the provider, simply use the project ID.
# - project_id can be found in the project `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
terraform import vercel_project_secure_compute_networks.example prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Alternatively, you can import via the team_id and project_id.
# - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
# - project_id can be found in the project `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
terraform import vercel_project_secure_compute_networks.example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
