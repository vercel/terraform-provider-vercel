# vercel_firewall_bypass (Resource)

Provides a Firewall Bypass Rule

Firewall Bypass Rules configure sets of domains and ip address to prevent bypass Vercel's system mitigations for.  The hosts used in a bypass rule must be a production domain assigned to the associated project.  Requests that bypass system mitigations will incur usage.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "firewall-bypass-example"
}

resource "vercel_firewall_bypass" "bypass_targeted" {
  project_id = vercel_project.example.id

  source_ip = "5.6.7.8"
  # Any project domain assigned to the project can be used
  domain = "my-production-domain.com"
  note   = "Bypass rule for specific IP"
}

resource "vercel_firewall_bypass" "bypass_cidr" {
  project_id = vercel_project.example.id

  # CIDR ranges can be used as the source in bypass rules
  source_ip = "52.33.44.0/24"
  domain    = "my-production-domain.com"
  note      = "Bypass rule for CIDR range"
}

resource "vercel_firewall_bypass" "bypass_all" {
  project_id = vercel_project.example.id

  source_ip = "52.33.44.0/24"
  # the wildcard only domain can be used to apply a bypass
  # for all the _production_ domains assigned to the project.
  domain = "*"
}
```
