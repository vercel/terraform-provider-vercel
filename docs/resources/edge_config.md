```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name/slug of the Edge Config.

### Optional

- `team_id` (String) The ID of the team the Edge Config should exist under. Required when configuring a team resource if a default team has not been set in the provider.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# If importing into a personal account, or with a team configured on
# the provider, simply use the edge config id.
# - edge_config_id is hard to find, but can be found by navigating to the Edge Config in the Vercel UI and looking at the URL. It should begin with `ecfg_`.
terraform import vercel_edge_config.example ecfg_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Alternatively, you can import via the team_id and edge_config_id.
# - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
# - edge_config_id is hard to find, but can be found by navigating to the Edge Config in the Vercel UI and looking at the URL. It should begin with `ecfg_`.
terraform import vercel_edge_config.example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/ecfg_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
