# vercel_project_environment_variables (Resource)

Provides a resource for managing a number of Project Environment Variables.

This resource defines multiple Environment Variables on a Vercel Project.

For more detailed information, please see the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

~> Terraform currently provides this Project Environment Variables resource (multiple Environment Variables), a single Project Environment Variable Resource, and a Project resource with Environment Variables defined in-line via the `environment` field.
At this time you cannot use a Vercel Project resource with in-line `environment` in conjunction with any `vercel_project_environment_variables` or `vercel_project_environment_variable` resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of settings and will overwrite Environment Variables.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "example-project"

  git_repository = {
    type = "github"
    repo = "vercel/some-repo"
  }
}

resource "vercel_project_environment_variables" "example" {
  project_id = vercel_project.test.id
  variables = [
    {
      key    = "SOME_VARIABLE"
      value  = "some_value"
      target = ["production", "preview"]
    },
    {
      key        = "ANOTHER_VARIABLE"
      value      = "another_value"
      git_branch = "staging"
      target     = ["preview"]
    },
    {
      key       = "SENSITIVE_VARIABLE"
      value     = "sensitive_value"
      target    = ["production"]
      sensitive = true
    }
  ]
}
```
