```terraform
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "example"

  git_repository = {
    type = "github"
    repo = "vercel/some-repo"
  }
}

# A shared environment variable that will be created
# and associated with the "example" project.
resource "vercel_shared_environment_variable" "example" {
  key    = "EXAMPLE"
  value  = "some_value"
  target = ["production"]

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The name of the Environment Variable.
- `project_ids` (Set of String) The ID of the Vercel project.
- `target` (Set of String) The environments that the Environment Variable should be present on. Valid targets are either `production`, `preview`, or `development`.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The value of the Environment Variable.

### Optional

- `sensitive` (Boolean) Whether the Environment Variable is sensitive or not. (May be affected by a [team-wide environment variable policy](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/sensitive-environment-variables#environment-variables-policy))
- `team_id` (String) The ID of the Vercel team. Shared environment variables require a team.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the Environment Variable.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import via the team_id and environment variable id.
# - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
# - environment variable id can be taken from the network tab inside developer tools, while you are on the project page.
#
# Note also, that the value field for sensitive environment variables will be imported as `null`.
terraform import vercel_shared_environment_variable.example team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/env_yyyyyyyyyyyyy
```
