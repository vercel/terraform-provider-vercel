# vercel_project_function_cpu (Resource)

Provides a Function CPU resource for a Project.

This controls the maximum amount of CPU utilization your Serverless Functions can use while executing. Standard is optimal for most frontend workloads. You can override this per function using the vercel.json file.

A new Deployment is required for your changes to take effect.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "vercel_project_function_cpu" "example" {
  project_id = vercel_project.example.id
  cpu        = "performance"
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import via the team_id and project_id.
# - team_id can be found in the team `settings` tab in the Vercel UI.
