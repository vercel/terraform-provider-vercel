# vercel_project_directory (Data Source)

Provides information about files within a directory on disk.

This will recursively read files, providing metadata for use with a `vercel_deployment`.

-> If you want to prevent files from being included, this can be done with a [vercelignore file](https://vercel.com/guides/prevent-uploading-sourcepaths-with-vercelignore).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# In this example, we are assuming that a nextjs UI
# exists in a `ui` directory and any terraform exists in a `terraform` directory.
# E.g.
# ```
# ui/
#    src/
#        index.js
#    package.json
#    // etc...
# terraform/
#    main.tf
# ```

data "vercel_project_directory" "example" {
  path = "../ui"
}

data "vercel_project" "example" {
  name = "my-awesome-project"
}

resource "vercel_deployment" "example" {
  project_id  = data.vercel_project.example.id
  files       = data.vercel_project_directory.example.files
  path_prefix = data.vercel_project_directory.example.path
}
```
