# vercel_project (Data Source)

Provides information about an existing project within Vercel.

A Project groups deployments and custom domains. To deploy on Vercel, you need a Project.

For more detailed information, please see the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "vercel_project" "foo" {
  name = "my-existing-project"
}

# Outputs prj_xxxxxx
output "project_id" {
  value = data.vercel_project.foo.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the project.

### Optional

- `team_id` (String) The team ID the project exists beneath. Required when configuring a team resource if a default team has not been set in the provider.

### Read-Only

- `automatically_expose_system_environment_variables` (Boolean) Vercel provides a set of Environment Variables that are automatically populated by the System, such as the URL of the Deployment or the name of the Git branch deployed. To expose them to your Deployments, enable this field
- `build_command` (String) The build command for this project. If omitted, this value will be automatically detected.
- `dev_command` (String) The dev command for this project. If omitted, this value will be automatically detected.
- `environment` (Attributes Set) A list of environment variables that should be configured for the project. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environment))
- `framework` (String) The framework that is being used for this project. If omitted, no framework is selected.
- `git_repository` (Attributes) The Git Repository that will be connected to the project. When this is defined, any pushes to the specified connected Git Repository will be automatically deployed. This requires the corresponding Vercel for [Github](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github), [Gitlab](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-gitlab) or [Bitbucket](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-bitbucket) plugins to be installed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--git_repository))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ignore_command` (String) When a commit is pushed to the Git repository that is connected with your Project, its SHA will determine if a new Build has to be issued. If the SHA was deployed before, no new Build will be issued. You can customize this behavior with a command that exits with code 1 (new Build needed) or code 0.
- `install_command` (String) The install command for this project. If omitted, this value will be automatically detected.
- `output_directory` (String) The output directory of the project. When null is used this value will be automatically detected.
- `password_protection` (Attributes) Ensures visitors of your Preview Deployments must enter a password in order to gain access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--password_protection))
- `public_source` (Boolean) Specifies whether the source code and logs of the deployments for this project should be public or not.
- `root_directory` (String) The name of a directory or relative path to the source code of your project. When null is used it will default to the project root.
- `serverless_function_region` (String) The region on Vercel's network to which your Serverless Functions are deployed. It should be close to any data source your Serverless Function might depend on. A new Deployment is required for your changes to take effect. Please see [Vercel's documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/regions) for a full list of regions.
- `trusted_ips` (Attributes) Ensures only visitors from an allowed IP address can access your deployment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--trusted_ips))
- `vercel_authentication` (Attributes) Ensures visitors to your Preview Deployments are logged into Vercel and have a minimum of Viewer access on your team. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vercel_authentication))
