# vercel_shared_environment_variable (Data Source)

Provides information about an existing Shared Environment Variable within Vercel.

A Shared Environment Variable resource defines an Environment Variable that can be shared between multiple Vercel Projects.

For more detailed information, please see the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables/shared-environment-variables).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Environment variables can be identified by their ID, or by their key and target.
# The ID can be taken from the network tab inside developer tools, while you are on the project page.
data "vercel_shared_environment_variable" "example" {
  id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

# Alternatively, you can use the key and target to identify the environment variable.
# Note that all `target`s must be specified for a match to be found.
data "vercel_shared_environment_variable" "example_by_key_and_target" {
  key    = "MY_ENV_VAR"
  target = ["production", "preview"]
}
```
