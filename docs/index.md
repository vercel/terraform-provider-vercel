# Vercel Provider

The Vercel provider is used to interact with resources supported by Vercel.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Vercel provider using the required_providers stanza.
# You may optionally use a version directive to prevent breaking
# changes occurring unannounced.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    vercel = {
      source  = "vercel/vercel"
      version = "~> 0.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "vercel" {
  # Or omit this for the api_token to be read
  # from the VERCEL_API_TOKEN environment variable
  api_token = var.vercel_api_token
}
```
